# dexmos

## TODO for demo

- UI to call driver code
- driver logic completion
- implement data fetching / cosmos calls (DriverClient)
- research what RPC methods correspond to deposit for LP, bond, and then maybe IPC out of osmosis to hold UST. The RPC method is what calls whenever you do a swap, bond, or IPC

## testing

first start the tests

```
cd ./packages/dexmos
yarn test:watch
```

hit "p" and then type a search string to scope to your test, e.g., "keplr.bank"
